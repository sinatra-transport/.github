Sinatra is a companion app for the Canberra MyWay+ network made by locals for locals. Our goal is to make it easier to find route and stop information, offering a fresh, streamlined experience alongside the official app.

We focus on delivering the key info you need, fast and frustration-free.

Sinatra is not affiliated with Transport Canberra, NEC, or MyWay+. Ticketing is not available in this app.
